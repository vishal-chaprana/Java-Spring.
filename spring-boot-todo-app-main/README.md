# spring-boot-todo-app
We are building a Todo manager. In our application, users can create, update,
view and delete various Todo items.

**To build our Todo application, we will use the following technologies/tools**:-
1. Spring Boot
2. H2 In-memory database
3. Spring Data JPA
4. BootStrap
5. Thymeleaf
6. Spring Tool Suite (STS)

**Home Page:**
Below is our application home page:-

**View All Todos:**
List of current Todos available in the application:-
![View All](https://github.com/sohamds1/spring-boot-todo-app/blob/main/proj%20shots/View%20all.png "View All")

View all Todo Items


**Update a Todo:**
In the application, uses can toggle the todo status. To demonstrate, we have
updated all our Todos to Yes:
![update](https://github.com/sohamds1/spring-boot-todo-app/blob/main/proj%20shots/update.png "update")

**Delete a Todo:**

Users can delete a Todo item from the application once it is done and not
required anymore. To demonstrate the usage, we have deleted the last two
Todos from the application:-

![Delete](https://github.com/sohamds1/spring-boot-todo-app/blob/main/proj%20shots/delete.png "Delete")

Remove Todos from the application

**Adding a new Todo:**
Application users can easily be able to add new Todo items in the application.
We have created a new Todo in our application and it is available in the todo
list:
![Adding](https://github.com/sohamds1/spring-boot-todo-app/blob/main/proj%20shots/adding.png "Adding")

<p>
  After all the configurations, the project has been given a little touch of Spring Security, so each time we restart the
  application, Spring generates a new password for us in the CLI.
